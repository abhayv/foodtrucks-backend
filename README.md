foodtrucks-backend
==================

These files are to be used with Google App Engine to serve as the backend for browsing food trucks in San Francisco.

The data pulled is from https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat which shows what
food truck permits have been issued by the city of San Francisco.

The backend is to be used with abhayv/foodtrucks-frontend which uses Google Maps to display the location of
food trucks.
